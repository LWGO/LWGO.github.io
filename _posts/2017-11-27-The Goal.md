title: The (real) Goal

---

"If you're not driving the business, then you're not driving your future." - 

Most business books are drivel. The reason business books have the reputation they do is that there's one good one for each thousand others. One of those good ones, however, is "The Goal" by Eliyahu Goldratt. Jeff Bezos requires incoming execs read it, and I've had it recommended by some well respected visiting speakers at HubSpot (where I work). 

The core lesson in the book is to avoid local maxima, and to make sure your systems are optimizing for the overall goal (hence the name). The story follows a manufacturing plant, but applies just as readily to many other businesses and their processes. The main character learns again and again how various parts of the plant need to be suboptimized in order to increase overall throughput.
