## Github Pages + Jekyll + Forestry.io = Win

It's 2020 and I've re-platformed my personal blog. (I'm sure you care!)

A personal blog is a great project to mess around with, especially since it's allegedly the best way show off your professional skillzâ„¢ if you're in tech.

As you can see, this blog is a minimalist, poorly-coded bastardization of an example. But I'm oddly proud of it (because it's mine, goddammit).

That said, I've turned the corner this year. I finally found the combination of free services to host & edit it completely painlessly (Forestry.io, Jekyll, and Github pages).

Since first starting to mess with a personal blog in 2017, I never wanted to pay Wordpress or Posthaven $5 a month, because I'm super cheap. I already felt I was shelling out for my custom domain, why pay even more?

Part of the problem was also that I should have been able to host this blog for free on HubSpot (because I work there), but there were too many power / custom features standing in my way. I wanted a simple, "just words" theme setup I liked, and I couldn't get there. (Here's hoping that changes in 2020.)

So, I gave a static site on Jekyll and Github Pages a try. It took a little fiddling, but it's pretty straightforward and allowed me to learn some HTML/CSS without actually needing to make the template myself. So I'd done it. * A wild blog appeared *.

The real problem with that setup was that I'd have to re-deploy EVERY TIME I wanted to change a typo or tweak a sentence. And as soon as I opened my terminal and started editing the repo, it was all too distracting. ...Maybe I should _adjust the padding a little_... then all of a sudden, it's 2 hours later and I wouldn't have anything written.

Even when I did manage to resist the temptation of messing with the layout, the writing experience was far from polished. I was stuck in a code editor wishing I could just write the post in a proper editor - something easy, like Medium or Substack. But that solution comes with the old, "you're renting time on someone else's platform" issue.

_(And yes, I'm aware Pages is now Microsoft, "the enemy", but at least it's on my domain - which is what those "don't write on medium" posts are really about anyways.)_

Then the other day I discovered the missing piece - [Forestry.io](www.forestry.io). It's exactly what I needed for my Jekyll+GH pages site! It allows me not only the basic layout control I wanted, but also the no-hassle blog post editing/publishing front end I was missing.

I'm optimistic I'll write more posts this year without those distractions. So if you're sick of paying $5 a month for the pleasure of updating your Wordpress plugins every month, check out this awesome new stack.
