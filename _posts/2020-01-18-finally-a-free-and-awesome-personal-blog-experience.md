### Forestry.io + Jekyll + Github pages

It's 2020 and I've re-platformed my personal blog. (I'm sure you care!)

A personal blog is a great project to mess around with, especially since it's allegedly the best way show off your professional skillzâ„¢ if you're in tech.

As you can see, this blog is a minimalist, poorly-coded bastardization of an example. But I'm oddly proud of it because it's mine, goddamnit. 

That said, I feel like I've turned the corner this year because I finally found the combination of free services to host & edit it completely free (Forestry.io, Jekyll, and Github pages)

Since first starting to mess with a personal blog in 2017, I never wanted to pay Wordpress or Posthaven $5 a month, because I'm super cheap and I already felt I was shelling out for my custom domain. Part of the problem was also that I should have been able to host my blog for free on HubSpot (because I work there), but there were too many power / custom features standing in my way to be able to get a simple, "just words" theme setup I liked. (Here's hoping that changes in 2020.)

So I gave a static site on Jekyll and Github Pages a try. It took a little fiddling, but it's pretty straightforward and allowed me to learn some HTML/CSS without actually needing to make the template myself. * A wild blog appeared *.

The real problem with that setup was that I'd have to deploy EVERY TIME I wanted to change a typo or tweak a sentence. And as soon as I opened my terminal and started editing the repo, it was all too distracting. ...Maybe I should _adjust the padding a little_... then 2 hours later I wouldn't have written a thing.

Even when I did manage to resist the temptation of messing with the layout, the writing experience was far from polished. I was stuck in a code editor wishing I could just write the post in a proper editor - something easy like Medium or Substack. But that solution comes with the old "you're renting time on someone else's platform" issue.

_(And yes, I'm aware Pages is now Microsoft, "the enemy", but at least it's on my domain - which is what those "don't write on medium" posts are really about anyways.)_

Then the other day I discovered the missing piece - Forestry.io . It's what I needed for my Jekyll+GH pages site to allow me the basic layout control I want, but with a beautiful, polished front-end that allows for easy blog post editing and publishing.

The opportunity to actually focus on writing instead of the technical distractions has me very optimistic that more posts will happen this year. And if you're sick of paying $5 a month for the pleasure of updating your Wordpress plugins every month, I recommend checking out this awesome new stack.
