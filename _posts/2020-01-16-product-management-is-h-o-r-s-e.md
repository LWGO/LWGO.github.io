title: Product Management is H-O-R-S-E

What’s the best way to get promoted in the mysterious field of product management?

Product leaders often don't make it clear to PMs what they value. Even the best attempts to define a career ladder seem to end up as [buckets of nebulous skills](https://www.intercom.com/blog/evolving-your-product-management-career-ladder). No matter how you slice it, product management is a squishy discipline.

So what should you _actually do_ to get promoted as a PM? My suggestion is to think about advancing your career using the classic basketball game, HORSE .

As in HORSE, to succeed in your product management career, you need to:

1\. Choose your shot,  
2\. Call your shot, and then  
3\. Make your shot.

Let’s dive into each one.

## Choosing your shot

One of the most important parts of HORSE is also one of the most important parts of the PM game. Selecting your shot is where you put on your strategy hat and figure out what your plan of attack should be.

This is pretty straightforward in HORSE. You can decide, for example, that you’re going to go for a high-volume strategy. Taking lots of easy shots you’re confident you can make. This can work in the PM world too. Choose a bunch of simple bug fixes and features that will let you build a steady lead on your competitors. Then knock ‘em out.

That said, in the PM game, whether you can do this depends on the product and the situation you inherit. You might not be able to bank on a strategy of easy layups, especially if you’re creating a new product from scratch. Like facing a stronger opponent on the basketball court, a competitive market will push you to take riskier shots to win the game. You might not hit all your shots in that scenario, but when you do, you’re almost guaranteed points.

In HORSE as in PMing, it’s worth thinking about the difficulty of the shots you’re planning. Be sure to balance some easy and some hard shots if you can - missing consistently isn't a good look.

## Calling your shot

In HORSE you have to describe what you’re about to do so the other person knows what you’re attempting. So, you were playing around and made a no-look, behind the back sky hook? Whoopdy shit - it only counts if you called it.

This is true for PMs too. To get credit for your work, you need to broadcast the problems you’ll be solving, why you’re solving them, and what the solutions will do. Without calling your shot, you can look like you got lucky. Maybe the success of your product was due to your team’s genius, rather than anything you contributed. To score points in the PM career game, you gotta call your shots.

This isn’t a political “get credit” issue, there’s actually a deeper reason that this analogy holds. Calling your shot as a PM is important for coordinating teams across the company. By calling your shot, you’re signaling to customer-facing teams what your priorities are (which shot you’re taking). You’re also giving them a chance to help you with your shot selection (by getting their feedback). And you’re letting them help you make the shot when they prepare customers for it.

In this way, calling your shot lets you adjust and improve your chances of choosing the best shot and making it. So choose your shot, then make sure you call it out loud and clear.

## Making your shots

Okay, so you decided if you’re going for a half-court trick shot or a layup, and you’ve announced what you’re gonna do. Now it’s showtime, and the **most crucial part** of both HORSE and building product: execute on the shot.

If you miss a shot in HORSE, the other player gets a chance to go on the offensive, and you’re forced to play their game. You cede control of the game to their strategy (not good). It’s not always as dire in the PM world, but it definitely puts you on the back foot when you miss.

To add to the complexity of product management, in the PM game you aren’t the one shooting. You’re more like a coach for the team that’s shooting the shot for you. You’re trying to give them all the advice you can, while not getting in their way or overwhelming them.

That means that “making the shot” as a PM is about giving your team frequent feedback about their work. Telling them what’s working on a strategic level (which shots are scoring points) as well as on a tactical level (shooting form). For a product, this manifests itself in metric-setting and constant customer feedback.

To win, you gotta hit shots. It’s tempting to move on and “choose and call” the next shot as a PM, so don’t forget, none of it matters if you don’t execute well.

The thing that gets product managers promoted is trust - trust that you are good at playing the product game. So while you can choose smart shots, and call them consistently, if at the end of the day you don’t make them, then nobody’s gonna bet on you. Make your shots.

## PM Career advice, simplified

So, if you’re a PM trying to show off your “leadership behaviors” or “insights driven nature”, take a step back. Instead, consider whether you’re winning your product’s game of HORSE.

Chances are you’ll gain trust (and get promoted) faster if you focus on:

1. Choosing good shots
2. Calling your shots
3. Making all your shots.
