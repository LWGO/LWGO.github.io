# Things I’ve learned by going remote

### 1. Manage emotions “bags of feelings”

### 2. Proactively be vulnerable - harder over video, important for trust 

### 3. A hangout meeting

### 4. Write it down

### 5. Remember to make time for practicing / iterating your pitches 

### 6. Drawing better boundaries (thanks to increased trust)

Thanks to everyone for making it work!
