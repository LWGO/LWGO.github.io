Hey there! Iâ€™m Lars. ![ðŸ‘‹]

I currently live in Eugene OR while my wife works her way through a PhD. I write about tech, product management, and other things as they occur to me.

* **Current work:** PM at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/)
* **Previous:** Element (consulting, acquired), Maponics (geofencing, acquired)
* **More previous:** Dartmouth College undergrad, then Poly sci masters from Uppsala University
* **Fun things**: I enjoy skiing, ultimate frisbee, dogs, and uncontroversial hobbies like â€˜readingâ€™.

At some point Iâ€™ll put together a primer for where to start, but first I need to amass enough posts for it to be warranted.

If you want updates with my new posts, drop your details in the form below:
